# The UNIQUE Community Calendar

The UNIQUE Community Calendar is a crowd-sourced resource for events
occurring in and around Qu√©bec that feature
machine learning, artificial antelligence, and neuroscience&mdash;
and especially work at their intersection.

In this, it highlights events of interest to the
[UNIQUE community](https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai).
Posting events is not restricted to UNIQUE community members, however!
All relevant posts are welcome.

You can view the calendar [here](http://tinyurl.com/OpenResearchCal) or
follow us on Twitter at [@CalendarUnique](https://twitter.com/CalendarUnique).

## Moderating events

We trust the community to use this calendar appropriately.
However, because events are posted automatically, there is a clear possibility of abuse.

If you notice any posting which is offensive, inappropriate, duplicated, or otherwise
contains incorrect or upsetting information, please report this directly.
We have created a [report link](http://tinyurl.com/rcu66l8) to expedite this process.

On receiving a report, calendar maintainers will review the flagged event details.
As this calendar is run as a volunteer, community-based service, response time may be delayed.

Ultimately, we take no responsibility for the content or administration of any events which appear in the calendar.
