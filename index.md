<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>

The service “Open Research Calendar ([@openresearchcal](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal))” was created as a community tool by the attendees of the ‘Advanced Methods in Reproducible Science’ workshop organised by the University of Bristol (also known on Twitter as [#Repro2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Repro2020)). The idea was initially generated by attendees of #Repro2019.

The tool was created to serve the open research community in collating worldwide open research events into one database. This translates onto a [Google Calendar](http://tinyurl.com/OpenResearchCal) which can be synced into a person's own personal calendar (updating as new events get added). You are advised to review information about calendared events carefully and use your best judgement before committing to attendance or entering into a transaction. We ultimately take no responsibility for the content or administration of any events which appear in the calendar.

As a community tool, we trust the community to use it appropriately. However, all operations of this tool are automated to expedite communication and this makes the tool vulnerable to spam or predatory events. We request that the events added are community policed. In that, if anything is seen to be wrong/ duplicated/ offensive/ inappropriate, we expect the community to report the event (using the [report link](http://tinyurl.com/rcu66l8) in our Twitter bio). A small team of administrators will then review the event details. As the admins volunteer for this, the response time may be delayed.
